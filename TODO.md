# TODO: Make Card Responsive for Consistent Download Across Screen Sizes

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Add media query for mobile (<768px): Adjust .card to 400px width/height, reduce font sizes proportionally, adjust margins and grid gaps
- [x] Add media query for tablet (768px-1199px): Adjust .card to 550px width/height, medium font sizes, adjust margins
- [x] Add media query for desktop (>=1200px): Keep .card at 650px width/height, full font sizes, original margins
- [x] Update .content grid to be more flexible if needed
- [x] Test the responsive layout on different screen sizes (simulate 13" phone, 17" laptop, 20"+ desktop) to verify the card fits and download matches preview
